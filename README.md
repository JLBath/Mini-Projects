# mini projects

These are all projects I made throughout my time in my ITSC 1213 class. 
Variable or object names are not as helpful as they could be, since I was trying to make the lab more enjoyable at 8 am. 
Most projects are unfinished or niche in application. This repository just shows what I have done 
at the beginning of my coding career.
